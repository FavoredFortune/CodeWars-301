*Capitalize Index- Kata 19 Code War 14*

**Problem Domain:** Given a string and an array of integers representing indices, capitalize all letters at the given indices.

**Thought process for solution:**

This time I pseudcoded with Rebecca, Austin and Kevin. Mob pseudocode. It was fun. 

Though, admittedly I felt a bit like Statler or Waldrof at the muppet show. Austin did the writing and I just kept asking questions, like, "Really? can you do that with an array?" "What about the string...let's review the order of steps." 

Then we took pictures and walked away. I went to talk to the instructors and by the time I got back Austin had solved it in 5 minutes.

It turns out we missed one key element of a solution in the pseudocode: what if the index numbers are higher than the numbers of characters within a string?

**Solution work:**
1. Made solutions.js

2. Made README

3. Trying the piece by piece approach again.

4. OMG! I don't know that it will always go this well, but I went piece by piece this time and it made sense to me and...I SOLVED IT!
