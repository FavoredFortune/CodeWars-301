**Problem Domain:** To take a string of words and find the highest value word, with each word's value being a sum of each letter's value with a=1 and incrementing on through z=26. There will be no empty strings. And if two words are of equal, highest value, the word that is earliest in the string is to be returned. 

**Thought process for solution:**

This time I pseudcoded with Rebecca, Austin, Peter and Ramon. Mob pseudocode. It was fun, but hard!

**Solution work:**
1. Made solutions.js

2. Made README

3. This time, based on today's conversation and coaching from Beverly, I'm just going to try one step at a time and do everything with loops, rather than using higher functions. Assuming I get the solution, I can work to refactor after.
