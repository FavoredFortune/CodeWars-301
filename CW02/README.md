**Problem Domain:** This code is meant move all the meerkat tails to the end of the array and all the heads to teh front of the array

**Thought process for solution:**

This time my partner and I came up with two solutions. Solution B, as show in the image below was more than the 4 steps we thought it would be so we both decided to Solution A first.

Solution B was to parse the array and then recreate the array after making each element in the original array a new variable and then reassign the variables in the correct order in a new array.

Solution A was to assign a variable to the first element in the array (index 0, aka "Tail") then assign that new variable to the correct spot in the array and then move the original "head" element in the index 2 of the array into the index 0 of the array. 

**Solution work:**
1. Made solutions.js

2. Made README

3. Wrote Solution A out and it worked - no errors in tests.
