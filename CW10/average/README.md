**Problem Domain:** This code is meant to calculate the average of numbers in an array.

**Thought process for solution:**

This time I pseudcoded alone

I figured if I could use reduce to total the array and then divide by the length of the array that should work.

**Solution work:**
1. Made solutions.js

2. Made README

3. Reviewed my class REPL on reduce (https://repl.it/@CodeMaven/REDUCE-CF-301)

4. Applied structure of code to this problem and SOLVED!
