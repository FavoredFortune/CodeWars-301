**Problem Domain:** Mutate one string into another string, one letter at a time starting with the first letter, returning each form of the mutation. 

**Thought process for solution:**

This time I pseudcoded with Rebecca, Austin, Kevin and Ramon chimed in at the end. Mob pseudocode. It was fun, but hard! We had a big debate the value of code-like pseduo code vs. just words...

**Solution work:**
1. Made solutions.js

2. Made README

3. This time, based on yesterdays's conversation and coaching from Beverly and Austin, plus a conversation with Brent and Zach, I'm just going to try one step at a time. Assuming I get the solution, I can work to refactor after. 

4. Revisted this tonight after chatting about it more with Austin and I think Josiah?(I can only remember it was someone taller than me and male, but I think it was him - today is fuzzy).

Also looked at my methods based on feedback from Shannon (notes below with sources). I was getting splice for an array and slice for a string confused (the .remove I had before was a mental placeholder to tell me to find a method to remove the first letter).

5. Got it confused and was using the first string in the for loop instead of the second string...once I figured that out, along with my other work, I realized I was not yet mastering replace or slice so it would be better to just stick with split and join. I say that so simply, but it took me about an hour and half to figure that out. I think I still keep trying to eat the whole elephant instead of eating one bite at a time. 

6. Kata solved, but need to keep working on repatterning my thought process.
