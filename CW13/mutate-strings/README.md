**Problem Domain:** Mutate one string into another string, one letter at a time starting with the first letter, returning each form of the mutation. 

**Thought process for solution:**

This time I pseudcoded with Rebecca, Austin, Kevin and Ramon chimed in at the end. Mob pseudocode. It was fun, but hard! We had a big debate the value of code-like pseduo code vs. just words...

**Solution work:**
1. Made solutions.js

2. Made README

3. This time, based on yesterdays's conversation and coaching from Beverly and Austin, plus a conversation with Brent and Zach, I'm just going to try one step at a time. Assuming I get the solution, I can work to refactor after. 

4.
