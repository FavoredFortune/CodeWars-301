*Username Validation with Regex - Kata 4 Day 4*

**Problem Domain:** This code meant to validate an username that is between 4 to 16 characters long and contains only lowercase letters, numbers and underscores. 

**Thought process for solution:**

This time my partner and I came up with a general pseudo code for our approach to the problem domain.

So we agreed we'd create a set of rules to do the following:
* make sure the string was between 4 and 16 characters
* make sure that the string contained only lowercase letters
* make sure that numbers were included
* make sure that underscores were included

**Solution work:**
1. Made solutions.js

2. Made README

3. Tried several methods for setting the rules and had it right in regex101.com but it wouldn't work in the kata

4. Paired with Beverly via Slack. We looked at each other's code and asked each other questions and gave hints. The thing I was originally missing? A / and the start and end of my command.
