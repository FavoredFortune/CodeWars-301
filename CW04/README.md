*Insert Dashes - Kata 3 Day 3*

**Problem Domain:** This code meant to insert dashes between odd numbers in a string and zero is not considered a number. 

**Thought process for solution:**

This time my partner and I came up with a general pseudo code for our approach to the problem domain.

I've modified it here, based on where I got to with the solution:
1. turn the string into an array of integers
2. find the odd integers
3. insert a dash inbetween the odd intergers

**Solution work:**
1. Made solutions.js

2. Made README

3. Tried several methods for turning array into integers and comparing numbers and while not getting errors in REPL, it doesn't pass any tests. 

4. I'm turning in the assignment as-is for now and hoping to find solution in the morning.
