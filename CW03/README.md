*Insert Dashes - Kata 3 Day 3*

**Problem Domain:** This code meant to insert dashes between odd numbers in a string and zero is not considered a number. 

**Thought process for solution:**

This time my partner and I came up with a general pseudo code for our approach to the problem domain.

I've modified it here, based on where I got to with the solution:
1. turn the string into an array of integers
2. find the odd integers
3. insert a dash inbetween the odd intergers

**Solution work:**
1. Made solutions.js

2. Made README

3. Decided to take a fresh eye to this and check my method useage. My String method use wasn't correct. Researched and found correct usage. 

4.  Applied .split method (after making sure I understood it).

5.
